In january 2013, I've got the chance to participate to the <a href="http://www.hec.fr/Grande-Ecole/Programme/Academies#anticipation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google@HEC E-Commerce Academy</a>. It's an intensive 3 weeks academy in partnership with HEC, Google, Epitech and Supinternet.We had to work with two HEC Students and One designer from Supinternet. 

The goal is to put various pleople issues from different school and formation together, and imagine a new innovative product to sell. This year, our subject was <a href="http://www.causses.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Causses and Lunchbox</a>.

In three weeks, we was able to build a concept, define the Marketing and Communication orientations, and develop an E-Commerce Website. 

Our concept was "Recreate some restaurant chef's recipe at your home.". So we had to form partnership with restaurants to get theirs recipes, and they got a lot of visibility and advertising.

During this Academy, we learned a lot about marketing, SEO and how to launch a new product.
(and alcohol resistance of HEC students !)

Those three weeks was just crazy, we had really interesting classes, a lot of work and a great project.
