Hey ! 

Everytime I have to create a presentation, I'm stuck with those three points : 
<ul>
	<li>What color(s) ? </li>
	<li>What font(s) ? </li>
	<li>What picture(s) ? </li>
</ul>  

Today, I'm gonna give you some tools to make better presentations. 

<h2> What color(s) </h2>
To make great presentations, you need great colors. All your slides in <b>black</b> are not really cool.
