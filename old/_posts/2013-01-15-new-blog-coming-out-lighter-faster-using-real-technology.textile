Hello, just to tell you that this is the new version of my blog, without this WordPress sucking all the shared server resources.

Seriously, it's really a heavy solution, I don't want to rent a dedicated server only for my blog. I need something more personal, faster, cheaper, and stronger.

So, I'm now using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a>, (thanks Julien !), and <strong>for free</strong>, use the <strong>GitHub page</strong>. <strong>Jekyll</strong> compile all your pages to give you a "static" site. So, I don't need PHP, I don't need a database. And, it's coded in <strong>RUBY</strong> !
<strong>
Here is a semi technique article to more describe Jekyll : <a href="http://thomas-romera.com/2013/01/19/How-Jekyll-Rock-With-Style/">How Jekyll Rock (With Style)</a>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img alt="Foundation Image" src="http://foundation.zurb.com/files/f3/foundation-monster-th.png" width="400" height="300" />
</div>
I will also give you a little talk about <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/"><strong>Foundation</strong></a>, a Framework for <strong>responsive design</strong>. I'm bored by Bootstrap and it documentation, really not developer-friendly, on my opinion.

Stay tuned !
