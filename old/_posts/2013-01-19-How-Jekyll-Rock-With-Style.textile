Some days ago, I told that I was working on a new blog. I also talked about Jekyll, a new system that allow you to make a great site (Static).

<strong>Jekyll</strong> is a simple, blog aware, <strong>static site generator</strong>. With it special directory structure, it allow you to write your article through <strong>Textile</strong> or <strong>Markdown</strong>, coupled with <strong>Liquid</strong> to create some "Dynamic content" and compile everything.
So, you can host your blog on Github for 0 $. <strong>Yes, 0 $.</strong> More informations on the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">Official GitHub documentation</a> !  
Jekyll can be installed with a simple <strong><cc>gem install jekyll</cc></strong>  

Be sure to install the right version, <strong>some compatibility issue can make you loose some time</strong> : 
<cc>
gem 'jekyll',     '=0.12.0'
gem 'liquid',     '=2.4.1'
gem 'redcarpet',  '=2.1.1'
gem 'maruku',     '=0.6.0'
gem 'rdiscount',  '=1.6.8'
gem 'RedCloth',   '=4.2.9'
</cc>

Then, I just used this fantastic website : <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Skeleton for Jekyll using Bootstrap</a> that let you fork a <strong>Jekyll skeleton</strong> with Bootstrap installed, comments, analytics, and a lot of good stuff. After that, I just created a new theme for Jekyll to <strong>integrate Foundation instead of Bootstrap</strong>.

All my website is on my Github, you can find it here : <a href="https://github.com/Erowlin/erowlin.github.com">My Github</a>. 
<strong>Feel free to Fork, modify, share !</strong> 

See you !
